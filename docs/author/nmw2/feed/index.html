<p><strong>Love Data Week: The 2020 U.S. Census</strong></p>



<p>Every 10 years, the decennial census allows the U.S. to fully count its population.&nbsp; This year, during the national research data initiative Love Data Week, the Division of Libraries will focus its programming on the U.S. Census.&nbsp; Census data not only determines political representation and federal funding allocations, it also plays and important role in supporting social science research.&nbsp; The Data Services team has put together a series of speakers and tutorials to bring awareness to the national initiative and examine the many ways the data can be used in scholarship and research.&nbsp; Many of our most popular tutorials will also be offered to mark Love Data Week. </p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Speakers</strong></p>



<p>Monday, February 10, 2:00-3:15<br>&#8220;Exploring the Census: Custom Data Extractions&#8221;</p>

<p>Every five years, the U.S. Census Bureau collects extensive statistics about businesses that are essential to understanding the American economy. This official count, the Economic Census, serves as the foundation for the measurement of U.S. businesses and their economic impact. Statistics from the economic<a href="https://phys.org/tags/census/"> census</a> are inputs to key measures of the US economy such as the<a href="https://phys.org/tags/gross+domestic+product/"> gross domestic product</a> (GDP), product accounts (NIPAs) and the Producer Price Index (PPI).&nbsp; These resources offer researchers deep and broad insights into the US Economy both today and in the past.</p>

<p>Once again we offered a visualization competition in which entrants could submit a map or visualization to compete for a prize. Our three winners were Yichun Liu, MS candidate in the School of Professional Studies, Emily Fenster, MA candidate in the Department of English, and Patrick Bond, MS candidate in Interdisciplinary Studies.</p>



<p>Liu&#8217;s interactive dashboard of plots and maps explores the place of Airbnb in New York City using data on listing pricing and types. Built in Tableau Public, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/yichun.liu#!/vizhome/NYCAirbnb-Copy/Dashboard3">Liu&#8217;s visualization can be accessed here</a>.</p>

<p>Fenster&#8217;s visual storytelling was built in ESRI StoryMaps using data gleaned from the nineteenth-century missionary work of Henry Chase and the Mariner&#8217;s Church among the sailors of New York&#8217;s Lower East Side. <a href="https://nyuds.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=01730a8d1073452c8fd9f0f52e867d96">Follow her visualization story here</a>.</p>

<p>Tableau Public was also the tool of choice used by Bond to build his <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/patrick.bond7611#!/vizhome/TerrorintheU_S_/TerrorintheU_S_1970-2018">investigation of terror attacks in the United States between 1970 and 2018</a>, a project built out of data from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism.</p>
