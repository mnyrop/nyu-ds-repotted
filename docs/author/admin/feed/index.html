<p>On <strong>Monday, October 12</strong>, <strong>2020</strong>, NYU Data Services will be taking time to learn and observe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Peoples%27_Day">Indigenous Peoples Day</a>. For us, this means pausing to reflect, through reading scholarship and other resources, on the manifold ways in which European colonialism has precipitated displacement, violence, disease and death upon those first living in North America.</p>

<p>NYU Libraries and <a href="https://guides.nyu.edu/dataservices">Data Services</a> are excited to announce that we have joined the <a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/">Data Curation Network</a> (DCN) and become one of ten partner institutions who distribute the work of curating research data and making it available for discovery and re-use (see the <a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/2019/07/31/nyu-joins-the-dcn/">DCN blog post</a> for the announcement). As data curators and participants in this network, we prepare and enrich research data to make them findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable in ways that expand beyond what a single library or institution might be able to do on its own. </p>



<p>So far, the network has <a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/data/">curated over 30 datasets</a> that pertain to a range of disciplines, and these datasets have been documented and deposited in repositories across the United States. A recent <a href="https://www.arl.org/data-curation-network-makes-more-research-data-available-to-all/">impact statement by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL)</a> notes the educative role the DCN holds in promoting well-documented and curated data practices in many library settings. The DCN has released a <a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/resources/">range of activities, best practices, and guides</a> to help institutions provide data access.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="480" height="212" src="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cropped-logo_dcn_verdanastack.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1336" srcset="https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cropped-logo_dcn_verdanastack.png 480w, https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/cropped-logo_dcn_verdanastack-300x133.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 85vw, 480px" /></figure>



<p>Although NYU&#8217;s involvement with the Data Curation Network is represented by <a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/wissel-katie/">Katie Wissel</a>, Data Services Librarian, and <a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/battista-andrew/">Andrew Battista</a>, Librarian for Geospatial Information Systems, we note that the Libraries has several people who have engaged with the project&#8217;s work, including <a href="https://library.nyu.edu/people/victoria-steeves/">Vicky Steeves</a>, Librarian for Research Data Management, <a href="https://library.nyu.edu/people/nicholas-wolf/">Nick Wolf</a>, Research Data Management Librarian, <a href="https://genevievemilliken.com/">Genevieve Milliken</a>, who is co-authoring one of the <a href="https://datacurationnetwork.org/resources/data-curation-primers/">DCN Primers</a>, and Kevin Read and Nicole Contaxis of the NYU Medical Library and data catalog, who have attended DCN training events and also participate in the <a href="https://www.datacatalogcollaborationproject.org/">Data Catalog Collaboration Project (DCCP)</a> for fostering discovery and use of biomedical data.</p>



<h2>What does this mean for the NYU research community?</h2>



<p>Now that NYU Libraries has joined the DCN, we invest a portion of our time to curate datasets that researchers at other institutions submit. However, it also means that we can benefit from the larger network of knowledge held by the other 25-plus curators.</p>



<ul><li>Anyone in the NYU community who is interested in contributing research data (to any repository) can reach out to us and receive assistance curating data.</li><li>Data Services will begin working to apply data curation principles as we acquire licensed data and make it available to the NYU community.</li></ul>



<p>We are excited about our partnership and look forward to a growing organization of curated data and shared labor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following is an excerpt from a blog post written by <a href="http://www.quirkos.com/about.html#team">Daniel Turner</a> about the International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry Conference, attended by NYU Data Services&#8217;s Sarah DeMott:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was lucky enough to attend the <a href="http://icqi.org/">ICQI 2016</a> conference last week in Champagne at the <a href="http://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois</a>. We managed to speak to a lot of people about using Quirkos, but there were hundreds of other talks, and here are some pointers from just a few of them!</p>
<p><strong>1. Qualitative research is like being at high school</strong><br />
Johnny Saldaña&#8217;s keynote described (with cutting accuracy) the research cliques that people tend to stick to. It&#8217;s important for us to try and think outside these methodological or topic boxes, and learn from other people doing things in different ways. With so many varied sessions and hundreds of talks, conferences like ICQI 2016 are great places to do this.</p>
<p>We were also treated to clips from high school movies, and our own Qualitative High School song! The Digital Tools thread got their own theme song: a list of all the different qualitative analysis software packages sung to the tune of &#8216;ABC&#8217; &#8211; the nursery rhyme, not the Jackson 5 hit!&#8221;</p>
<p>Read the last 6 things learned here: <a href="http://www.quirkos.com/blog/post/international-congress-qualitative-inquiry-icqi2016">http://www.quirkos.com/blog/post/international-congress-qualitative-inquiry-icqi2016</a></p>
