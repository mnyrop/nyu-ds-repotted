<a href="http://lovedataweek.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Love Data Week</a> (formerly Love Your Data Week) has arrived! This year&#8217;s theme is telling stories with data, and in that spirit Data Services will be hosting a series of workshops designed to think about how you can transform your data, code, and research into effective publications. We&#8217;ll look at how you can build an online profile that will allow you to persistently link your publications and data to your researcher identity, and look at ways to ensure you get credit for citations of your research. We&#8217;ll cover &#8220;executable papers&#8221; such as those created in Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown that enable you to dynamically combine code with research findings, and look at ways to quickly move those papers to the web. We&#8217;ll also feature a &#8220;Love is in the Air!&#8221; day-long mapping event on Wednesday. Look for us on Twitter @nyudataservices to follow along with tips and tools, and right here on the Data Dispatch for more telling stories with data posts.

<p><strong>About the Collection and Data Release</strong></p>
<p>The 2015 LiDAR dataset is a landmark acquisition for geospatial data collections at NYU Libraries. It is the first time since the launch of our new Spatial Data Repository in 2016 that the GIS team has worked with researchers at NYU to bring a complex, multi-format original dataset into our collection. Many thanks to Stephen Balogh, Brittney ONeill, Ahn-Vu Vo, and others who put in incredible amounts of work on organizing the data for release and developing capacity for it.</p>
<p>Because of the size and complexity of the data, we had to take several new steps in order to present the data with enough spatial context to be useful to a range of geospatial researchers. One of the most frequent questions we anticipate about this data is, &#8220;what is it, and what can you do with it?&#8221; To help, the team has provided a 3D rendering of what the <a href="https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/ALSDublin15/potree/Dublin15.html">point cloud data</a> looks like when visualized (see below).</p>
<style type="text/css">

<p>This is just one section of point cloud data, which anyone can download and visualize with a library like <a href="http://www.potree.org/">Potree</a>, though even this visualization is presenting a compressed and down-sampled version of the full waveform LiDAR, which is made available in LAS and Pulsewaves formats. Professor Laefer&#8217;s team has provided very robust documentation about the use of this data in research, and its <a href="https://osf.io/dk73g/wiki/home/">application for urban informatics scholarship</a>. To date, this type of data has been used to explore the detection of road curbs and obstacles, tree growth, and more.</p>
<p>The size and complexity of the data associated with the 2015 aerial laser scan has also required us to revise some of the ways that we have been presenting spatial data. In total, the data associated with just a two square kilometer area in Dublin is well over one terabyte and comes in at least four different formats, including point cloud, full waveform, and infrared GeoTIFF. We needed efficient ways for users to explore smaller subsets of the data and download files efficiently, so we expanded the interface of GeoBlacklight to afford for discovery according to individual flight paths or area of coverage.</p>

Users can click on individual tiles or lines (which represent discrete flight paths) in order to download the datasets associated with that area or flight.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Through our spatial discovery application, GeoBlacklight, users can find sections or subsets of the data that are important to them and download accordingly. We hope that this release of LiDAR data benefits the larger geospatial community, and we encourage you to explore the complete collection within NYU&#8217;s Spatial Data Repository.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The results of a crowd-sourced georectification project within Data Services have come to fruition as the NYU Spatial Data Repository has now released its rectified collection of topographic maps of Saudia Arabia and nearby regions. Produced by the Soviet military in 1978 at a 1:100,000 scale, the maps were compiled through a combination of aerial intelligence and on-the-ground observation. These maps are part of an endeavor, unknown in its extent at the time, that has been described as one of the &#8220;most comprehensive global topographic mapping project ever undertaken.&#8221;<sup>1</sup> Among their striking features are the close detail available on each sheet.<br />
<figure id="attachment_864" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-864" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" src="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet-300x300.png" alt="The cities of Dhahran and Al Khobar in Saudia Arabia" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-864" srcset="https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet-300x300.png 300w, https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet-150x150.png 150w, https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet-768x768.png 768w, https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-864" class="wp-caption-text">The cities of Dhahran and Al Khobar in Saudia Arabia</figcaption></figure>
Data Services team members and friends gathered for two sessions over the last few months to georectify the maps in the open-source GIS software QGIS. Using bounding coordinate information listed on the maps, 441 map tiles were rectified and reprojected so that they could be displayed and used in GIS software alongside other raster and vector layers in standard WGS 84 (i.e. the World Geodetic System 1984, the standard spatial reference system). </p>
<p>Although human settlement features can be found in detail throughout the collection, they also describe a range of environmental features with hundreds of distinguished land and land-use types from categories of agriculture to forest, grass, soil types, and even five types of sand. Coastal areas can be compared to current coastlines to measure erosion and sea-level changes. Not conversant in Russian? An in-depth technical manual prepared by the U.S. Army in English, and available with the collection, will be your guide. To view the collection with spatial preview, <a href="https://geo.nyu.edu/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=Soviet%20Military%20Topographic%20Maps&#038;per_page=20" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br /></br><br />

GIS Day is an international celebration of geospatial technology and data and is part of National Geographic Awareness Week. This year, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/nyu.edu/nyugisday/home" target="_blank">GIS Day @ NYU</a> featured the return of the interactive Augmented Reality Sandbox exhibit and the highly anticipated Mapping Competition. Nine guest speakers who use GIS in their research and various projects presented on their latest work, among them the construction of a digital time machine using the New York Public Library&#8217;s collections, mapping dialect differences in the UK, and smart cities using GIS visualization and bio-sensor data.<br />
