As data curators and participants in this network, we prepare and enrich research data to make them findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable in ways that expand beyond what a single library or institution might be able to do on its own. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the network has <a href=\"https:\/\/datacurationnetwork.org\/data\/\">curated over 30 datasets<\/a> that pertain to a range of disciplines, and these datasets have been documented and deposited in repositories across the United States. A recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arl.org\/data-curation-network-makes-more-research-data-available-to-all\/\">impact statement by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL)<\/a> notes the educative role the DCN holds in promoting well-documented and curated data practices in many library settings. The DCN has released a <a href=\"https:\/\/datacurationnetwork.org\/resources\/\">range of activities, best practices, and guides<\/a> to help institutions provide data access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"480\" height=\"212\" src=\"http:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/cropped-logo_dcn_verdanastack.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/cropped-logo_dcn_verdanastack.png 480w, https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/cropped-logo_dcn_verdanastack-300x133.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 85vw, 480px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although NYU&#8217;s involvement with the Data Curation Network is represented by <a href=\"https:\/\/datacurationnetwork.org\/wissel-katie\/\">Katie Wissel<\/a>, Data Services Librarian, and <a href=\"https:\/\/datacurationnetwork.org\/battista-andrew\/\">Andrew Battista<\/a>, Librarian for Geospatial Information Systems, we note that the Libraries has several people who have engaged with the project&#8217;s work, including <a href=\"https:\/\/library.nyu.edu\/people\/victoria-steeves\/\">Vicky Steeves<\/a>, Librarian for Research Data Management, <a href=\"https:\/\/library.nyu.edu\/people\/nicholas-wolf\/\">Nick Wolf<\/a>, Research Data Management Librarian, <a href=\"https:\/\/genevievemilliken.com\/\">Genevieve Milliken<\/a>, who is co-authoring one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/datacurationnetwork.org\/resources\/data-curation-primers\/\">DCN Primers<\/a>, and Kevin Read and Nicole Contaxis of the NYU Medical Library and data catalog, who have attended DCN training events and also participate in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.datacatalogcollaborationproject.org\/\">Data Catalog Collaboration Project (DCCP)<\/a> for fostering discovery and use of biomedical data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does this mean for the NYU research community?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that NYU Libraries has joined the DCN, we invest a portion of our time to curate datasets that researchers at other institutions submit.
