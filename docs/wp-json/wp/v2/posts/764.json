As providers of services using these technologies, we must be aware of this issue and seek to mitigate it.<\/li>\n<li>Nostalgic for the older days of Mosaic, Netscape Navigator, and early Internet Explorer? Try <a href=\"http:\/\/oldweb.today\/\" target=\"_blank\">oldweb.today<\/a>, an emulator of historic browsers that can be used to view all websites, old and new. Essential for web archivists!<\/li>\n<li>Keynote <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.lita.org\/speakers\/waldo-jaquith\/\" target=\"_blank\">Waldo Jaquith<\/a>, director of U.S. Open Data, shared his surprising story about the ways an agency&#8217;s decisions to charge for their data had ended up costing more money in lost tax revenue than was gained. Jaquith&#8217;s project to make state of Virginia data open and redistribute it in a user-friendly version, <a href=\"https:\/\/vabusinesses.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">vabusinesses.org<\/a>, is a story of how open data (and citizen-led projects to clean, improve, and distribute that data) can lead to a greater social good.<\/li>\n<li>Are you a user or creator of a LibGuide?
