Current holdings include data associated with over 220 different journals and 12,700 researchers. Dryad balances the need for low barriers facilitating researcher contribution and higher-level goals supporting data discovery, scientific verification, and repurposing. Metadata is a fundamental component of Dryad\u2019s infrastructure. The Dryad development team has pursued an active metadata R&amp;D agenda to meet project goals. This presentation will give an overview of the Dryad repository and the project\u2019s metadata research roadmap. Research targeting metadata reuse, DOI (data object identifier) residency, and data relationships will be highlighted. The presentation will briefly comment on HIVE (Helping Interdisciplinary Vocabulary Engineering) project, and work under way for semantic annotation of data in the linked data environment.<\/p>\n<p>Biographical Note: Jane Greenberg is director of the Metadata Research Center (<a href=\"http:\/\/ils.unc.edu\/mrc\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/ils.unc.edu\/mrc\/<\/a>) and a professor at the School of Information and Library Science (SILS), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Her research and teaching focus on metadata generation, web semantics\/linked data, ontological engineering, and knowledge organization. She a PI for the HIVE initiative and a coPI on the Dryad repository project. Professor Greenberg has served on the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative&#8217;s (DCMI) Advisory Board since 2005; she also co-leads the DCMI Science and Metadata community, the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Metadata Interest Group, and the DataONE Preservation and Metadata Working Group (PAMWG).<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please join us on\u00a0Wednesday, June 19 from 11am-12pm in the AFC East Room (2nd floor, Bobst Library) for &#8220;Metadata R&amp;D: Research Data and the Scholarly Communication Workflow,&#8221; a talk and Q&amp;A session with\u00a0Jane Greenberg, director of the Metadata Research Center, focusing on the\u00a0Dryad scientific data repository\u00a0and the Dryad team&#8217;s metadata research &amp; development agenda.
