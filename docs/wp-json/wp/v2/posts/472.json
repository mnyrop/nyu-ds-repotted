This constantly updated dataset records storm activities from 1950 to the present, including the dates, locations, and type of storms. NOAA presents these datasets in a series of CSVs, each dedicated to a single year, and our task using Python was to automate the downloading and merging of these files to create a single dataset of 1.35 million records.<\/p>\n<p>I thought it would be worthwhile to take a look at the data on a map. As NOAA notes, its dataset for the years before 1992 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/stormevents\/details.jsp?type=collectionhttp:\/\/www.ncdc.noaa.gov\/stormevents\/details.jsp?type=collection\" target=\"_blank\">were keyed from printed storm data publications<\/a>, and the type of events recorded from that source were limited. From the mid-1990s on, a much expanded list of storm types were recorded, and born-digital files replaced keyed data as the source of the dataset. <\/p>\n<p>Below are the results for the decades between 1950 and 1989, concentrating on tornado events. Start and end coordinates for tornadoes were provided in the dataset, making them a tempting candidate for visualizing storm paths.  I limited the time span to the years prior to 1990 to account for the change in recording (and with it, the nature of the collected data) in the 1990s. This ultimately yielded a much smaller dataset of just over 10,000 events. On the map below, select a decade and click on a line depicting a storm path to access further information.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"mapleafheader\">Storm Events: The 1950s<\/h3>\n<div id=\"storm-map\"><\/div>\n<p><button id=\"bn1950\" onclick=\"layer1950()\">1950s<\/button><button id=\"bn1960\" onclick=\"layer1960()\">1960s<\/button><button id=\"bn1970\" onclick=\"layer1970()\">1970s<\/button><button id=\"bn1980\" onclick=\"layer1980()\">1980s<\/button><\/p>\n<p>On a side note, the data prompted me to search for a personally memorable tornado event, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imfromdenver.com\/the-most-destructive-tornado-in-denver-metro-history\/\" target=\"_blank\">Thornton, Colorado, tornado of 3 June 1981<\/a> that I experienced as a child growing up in the Denver area and that prompted a stressful afternoon spent sheltered in the basement.
