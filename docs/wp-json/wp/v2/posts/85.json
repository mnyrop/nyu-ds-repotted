They enable important tasks such as forecasting system behavior for various \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios, characterizing system response, and designing control systems.\u00a0 This session will show how you can use MATLAB products for mathematical modeling tasks, including:<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Developing models using data fitting and first-principle modeling techniques<\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Optimizing the accuracy of mathematical models<\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Simulating models and post-processing the results<\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Documenting and sharing models<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>You will also learn about different approaches you can use to develop models, including developing models programmatically using the MATLAB language, deriving closed-form analytical equations using symbolic computation, and leveraging prebuilt graphical tools for specific modeling tasks such as curve and surface fitting.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>2pm-4pm<\/div>\n<div>Session 2:\u00a0 Parallel Computing with MATLAB<\/div>\n<div>In this session, you will learn how to solve computationally and data-intensive problems using multicore processors, GPUs, and computer clusters. We will introduce you to high-level programming constructs that allow you to parallelize MATLAB applications without CUDA or MPI programming and run them on multiple processors. We will also show you how to overcome the memory limits of your desktop computer and solve problems that require manipulating very large matrices by distributing your data.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Highlights include:<\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Toolboxes with built-in support for parallel computing<\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Creating parallel applications to speed up independent tasks<\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Programming with distributed arrays to work with large data sets<\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Scaling up to computer clusters, grid environments, or clouds<\/div>\n<div>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tips on developing parallel algorithms<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please join MathWorks for two different MATLAB seminars on\u00a0Thursday, March 7, 2013 at NYU\u2019s Kimmel Center, Room 802 (Shorin Studio). **These technical seminars are FREE for all NYU faculty, staff, researcher and students.** ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Tips and Tricks for using MATLAB at New York University ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Presenter: Gerardo Hernandez, MathWorks Technical Application Engineer 10am-12pm Session 1: &hellip; <a href=\"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/tips-and-tricks-for-using-matlab-at-nyu\/\" class=\"more-link\">Continue reading<span class=\"screen-reader-text\"> &#8220;Tips and Tricks for using MATLAB at NYU&#8221;<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/85"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=85"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/85\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":304,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/85\/revisions\/304"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=85"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=85"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=85"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
