We recommend that you read the <a href=\"https:\/\/nyu.box.com\/s\/4r5shjxb8qigtfhb71cqocvyzl9u14wl\">Gallup World Poll Methodology <\/a> but also read through the <a href=\"https:\/\/nyu.box.com\/s\/jql1mxj5u7qdq1sn8p202305ktsfyfhf\">World Poll Codebook<\/a>. The codebook gives you an overview of all variables present, and you can discover what you need by doing some Ctrl+F searching in the PDF document.\u00a0Your data extract request should be informed by a research question that has some logical boundaries.<\/p>\n<p>To help the Data Services team\u00a0access the subset of data that you need, all you have to do from here is get back to us with a list of variables from the data you would like. This list should (ideally) encompass theme, place, and timespan. For example, if your research question is about perception of gender equity in European Union countries, your request list might look something like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>D7 &#8211; What is your gender?<\/li>\n<li>D6 &#8211; What is your race?<\/li>\n<li>UCLA3A &#8211; Do you describe yourself as male, female, or transgender?<\/li>\n<li>WP1223 &#8211; What is your marital status?<\/li>\n<li>WP1146 &#8211; &#8220;&#8230;women should hold leadership&#8230;&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>WP646 &#8211; &#8220;&#8230;women should have same rights as men&#8230;&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Countries &#8211; (e.g., France, Germany, Italy, Spain)<\/li>\n<li>Dates (e.g., 2008-2012)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This list is meant to be a sample; your request will likely contain many more variables. Once we have the list of variables you need, we\u00a0will compile a data extract and deliver it to you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Indicators like gender or educational attainment, which may be useful for your analysis but not directly related to your question, exist as their own question QTAGs (variables), so you may want to request the inclusion of these for more robust analysis. Also note that the data includes methodological variables that may be useful for analysis (e.g., D9 &#8220;How many adults are in your household,&#8221;) may be useful as well, and you should request these. Also note that the phraseology of the questions changes slightly from year to year, and if you are interested in creating time series analyses, you may need to request variables that are related conceptually but are distinct in the layout of this data.<\/p>\n<p>Note also that the PDF we have created is meant to be an introduction to the data. There are many more questions in the World Poll survey, and these can also be discovered by creating an account with <a href=\"https:\/\/wpr.gallup.com\/signin\/default.aspx\">Gallup&#8217;s World Poll Reference Tool<\/a>.\u00a0The Reference Tool is <em>not<\/em> the source of the data itself but instead a search mechanism to discover which questions were asked in specific countries during specific years. You can use this tool to locate variables you&#8217;d like to extract. Refer to the <a href=\"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/World-Poll-reference-tool-2.pdf\">World Poll Reference Tool Guidebook<\/a> for instructions on creating an account and performing searches.<\/p>\n<p>There are several ways you can discover which questions or data is available. You can search by place (country), year, and theme or topic. Say\u00a0you are interested in researching the concept of happiness in the world. You can enter a keyword search for &#8220;happiness&#8221;:<a href=\"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Gallup-World-Poll-Reference-Tool.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-650 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Gallup-World-Poll-Reference-Tool-1024x283.png\" alt=\"gallup-world-poll-reference-tool\" width=\"840\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Gallup-World-Poll-Reference-Tool-1024x283.png 1024w, https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Gallup-World-Poll-Reference-Tool-300x83.png 300w, https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Gallup-World-Poll-Reference-Tool-768x213.png 768w, https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Gallup-World-Poll-Reference-Tool.png 1037w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px\" \/><\/a>It helps to enter keywords that are liable to be included in the text of a\u00a0question itself.

There is no comparable discovery tool for U.S. Daily Tracking poll questions; instead, users are encouraged to search in the codebooks listed below. We have also created a <a href=\"https:\/\/nyu.app.box.com\/s\/6iw38pbv3t93xwvhyqk4ss1y5sv4hlo8\"> matrix of available variables across years<\/a> for your reference. Follow the same process of assembling question variable as described in the World Poll section above. The only significant difference is that you will want to indicate variables that you want that specify the geographic location of the respondent. And because of the mixed-methdology approach of gathering the data (<a href=\"https:\/\/nyu.box.com\/s\/k0zdstmqj25ywvojpv9k3p4zcwnno9cv\">see the U.S. Daily Tracking Poll Methodology<\/a>), we highly recommend that you request weight variables as well.<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Request_Gallup_GPSS_Datasets\"><\/span><strong>How to Request Gallup GPSS Datasets<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>The Gallup Poll Social Series (GPSS) dataset \u00a0is a set of public opinion surveys designed to monitor U.S. adults&#8217; views on numerous social, economic, and political topics. The topics are arranged thematically across 12 surveys and change each month. Gallup administers these surveys during the same month every year and includes the survey&#8217;s core trend questions in the same order each administration (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/175307\/gallup-poll-social-series-methodology.aspx\">see GPSS methodology<\/a>). Using this consistent standard allows for unprecedented analysis of changes in trend data that are not susceptible to question order bias and seasonal effects.<\/p>\n<p>NYU&#8217;s respondent-level data coverage of this series goes back to January of 2019. Each month has its own codebook (see below), and while the themes of each month&#8217;s data are focused, many core questions tend to get asked in multiple surveys. And while the structure, methodology, and sample size is roughly equivalent across months, there are some particularities to each unique survey, so like the U.S. Daily Tracking data, we recommend requesting weighting variables as well. To make a data request, indicate which survey you want and which variables you would like in your extract. Note that access to this data must be mediated by NYU Data Services.<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Request_Access_to_the_COVID19_Panel_Data\"><\/span><strong>How to Request Access to the COVID-19 Panel Data<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>The COVID-19 web survey began on March 13, 2020 with daily random samples of U.S. adults, aged 18 and older who are members of the Gallup Panel. Approximately 1,200 daily responses were collected from March 13 through April 26, 2020. From April 27 to August 16, 2020 approximately 500 daily responses are being collected. Starting August 17, 2020, the survey moved from daily surveying to a survey conducted one time per month over a two-week field period (typically the last two weeks of the month).<\/p>\n<p>The Gallup Panel is a probability-based, nationally representative panel of U.S. adults. Members are randomly selected using random-digit-dial phone interviews that cover landline and cellphones and address-based sampling methods. The Gallup Panel is not an opt-in panel. Gallup weights the obtained samples each day to adjust for the probability of select and to correct for nonresponse bias. Nonresponse adjustments are made by adjusting the sample to match the national demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education and region. Demographic weighting targets are based on the most recent Current Population Survey figures for the aged-18-and-older U.S. population.<\/p>\n<p>In order to request an extract of this data, please get in touch with Data Services and indicate which variables you would like.<\/p>\n<h5><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Full_List_of_Codebooks\"><\/span><strong>Full List of Codebooks<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>To help make working with the data a little easier once you&#8217;ve gotten access to it, we&#8217;ve generated some codebooks to interpret the variables and range of answers within each question.
