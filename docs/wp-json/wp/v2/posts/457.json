In these tools, you can explore specific indicators and extract data for them at the country level. While this capability is good, it&#8217;s somewhat limited in that you cannot search multiple indicators across survey and countries at the same time. Now, NYU has access to the data behind the scenes! If you get in touch with us at Data Services, we can give you access to Gallup&#8217;s World Poll reference tool, which allows you to sift through respondent-level data and search specific indicators across time and space.
