Our research data does so much for us . . . why not return the favor?<\/p>\n<p>Caring for your data means investing in ways to better organize, share, preserve and reuse research materials of all types and sizes. Sustainable research data forms the bedrock of scientific inquiry, and yet scholars often fail to create a suitable environment for that data to be used and reused in the future. Good decisions made about file formats, data documentation, project management, and repository selection are all key steps to ensuring that one&#8217;s research data does not become obsolete despite the years of hard work and resources that are required to produce those materials. <\/p>\n<p>Throughout the week, participating institutions and researchers will be sharing tips and resources for data stewardship on Twitter via #LYD16.
