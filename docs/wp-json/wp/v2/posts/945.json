Other data that can use a helping hand include data in a stable format that simply needs some further enrichment to see their full potential, and data at risk of disappearance because of <a href=\"http:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/saving-data-preservation-during-political-turmoil\/\">a change in administrative oversight or ideological outlook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Data Services hosted a <a href=\"http:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/data-services-adds-georeferenced-soviet-maps\/\">data enrichment hack-a-thon<\/a> for Soviet-era maps that had been digitized in tiff format, but not yet georeferenced so that they could be displayed in a GIS system. Moving that spatial data from a basic digital format to an image format with embedded spatial referents involved a bit of manual labor by hack-a-thon participants, reminding us that some of the best data rescues involve collective efforts. In the end, a helpful new resource was built for researchers out of a set of files that had been in need of a little love and attention.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you&#8217;ve taken some time out of your schedule this week to think about the future of your research data.
