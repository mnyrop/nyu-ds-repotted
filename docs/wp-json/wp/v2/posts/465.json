While data and data analysis play a central role in many scientific domains, most papers specify their methods and data only informally and omit important supplemental material. High quality journals have responded to this issue by making reproducibility a requirement for publication. Understanding the challenges \u00a0to reproducibility and combating them with tools and best practices is therefore \u00a0of cross-disciplinary relevance.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/msdse.org\/\">Moore-Sloan Data Science Environment<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/msdse.org\/\">at NYU<\/a> is pleased to announce a symposium on reproducibility that will be held on May 3, 2016. The symposium will consist of keynotes and tutorial sessions in the morning, followed by discussions of research topics in reproducibility and hands-on sessions in the afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>The schedule is forthcoming.
