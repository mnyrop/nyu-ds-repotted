Free software does not rely on anything that is proprietary, nor does it place restrictions on people&#8217;s ability to modify it or share it, provided that they make such modifications accessible to everyone. Stallman drives a hard line between people who are committed to free software and those who stop at open source. I would argue that the distinction between the two means a lot less than the distinction between open source and proprietary or commercial software. This is particularly true in a community (GIS) that is dominated by a multi-billion dollar giant, ESRI, that is proprietary in all of the worst ways. But nevertheless, people were moved, and Stallman was able to auction off a stuffed gnu for $300 (which was donated to the Foundation).<\/p>\n<p><strong>2) Developing software in a community does not often remunerate individuals adequately, but it can generate social capital within that community.<\/strong> This was one of the points brought up by Paul Ramsey in his talk, <a href=\"http:\/\/foss4g.guide\/#9M4SVbRbRSxw0c1Mt0\">Why We Code.<\/a>\u00a0In general, I am fascinated (and often in awe of) the efforts that people in the geospatial and library discovery community have made to develop software that benefits a very large collective. <a href=\"http:\/\/projectblacklight.org\/\">Blacklight<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/geoblacklight.org\/\">GeoBlacklight<\/a> are two examples of this. I have worked in these communities to an extent but haven&#8217;t done active developing. Thus, I&#8217;m keen to the dynamic that Ramsey was talking about, and I wonder how others who do develop feel about it. Is the social capital real? Is it desirable in any way?<\/p>\n<p><strong>3) The geospatial world needs better, fluid tools to edit and create metadata.<\/strong> We discovered this (and arguably demonstrated it) in the pre-conference <a href=\"http:\/\/tiny.cc\/foss4g2017\">workshop we led<\/a> on creating GeoBlacklight metadata. There were a number of people at the conference from <a href=\"http:\/\/geonetwork-opensource.org\/\">GeoNetwork<\/a>, an open source metadata editor, but there were a lot of discussions about the ever-developing standards and practices in the GeoBlacklight and <a href=\"http:\/\/opengeoportal.org\/\">OpenGeoPortal<\/a> communities. We had a very fruitful meeting to talk about some possibilities, including the development of a common Solr core schema (see <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1gOHiqjrG6Y2I9K5S6rpHElHCv3wjn-GaxNv18_uDBqg\/edit?usp=sharing\">notes from that meeting here<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><strong>4) The &#8220;under the hood&#8221; process of Carto&#8217;s new spatial analysis features is a great project called Crankshaft.<\/strong> I got to see Carto&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MrEPhysics\">Andy Eschbacher<\/a> give an overview of the tool, which embeds Python modules within PostgreSQL database search commands. I think it&#8217;s great that Carto makes this source code available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5) Magic still happens at Fenway Park.<\/strong> We got a chance to slip away from the conference and take in a game at Fenway. And like the days of old, <a href=\"http:\/\/m.mlb.com\/news\/article\/45075964\/fenway-parks-anthem-started-innocuously\/\">a stirring rendition of &#8220;Sweet Caroline&#8221; brought the melancholy crowd back to life<\/a> and led to a great 9th inning comeback. The Sox won on a walk off.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I&#8217;m happy to be back at NYU after a brief research break and a trip to Boston for FOSS4G.
