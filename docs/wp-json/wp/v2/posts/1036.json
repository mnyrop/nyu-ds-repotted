Watkins suggests that many faculty\u00a0&#8220;have restrictive source requirements that mirror and perpetuate the systematic exclusion of indigenous knowledge from academia.&#8221; The &#8220;Authority is Constructed and Contextual&#8221; Frame provides many opportunities to discuss this in practice with students.

Nicole and Marybeth modeled several activities, including <a href=\"http:\/\/shelfcheck.blogspot.com\/2014\/01\/cards-against-librarianship-lets-play.html\">Librarian Cards Against Humanity<\/a>.
