This is accomplished by having your data saved in <strong>three<\/strong> places: on two hard drives and a cloud, or on a hard drive and two cloud instances.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/2016-02-08_Twitter_321Rule-e1454945738842.png\" alt=\"Keep your data safe image\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-346\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But remember that a good storage environment needs updating. You data is probably constantly being changed and versioned. So a good storage setup also includes robust provisions for tracking versioning and storing older instances of files. Consider setting up an automated backup schedule, a common feature on many external hard drives, and look for cloud services such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nyu.edu\/life\/resources-and-services\/information-technology\/websites-storage-and-sharing\/nyu-box.html\" target=\"_blank\">NYU Box<\/a> that track file changes. Most importantly, work out a file version naming system and document the contents of data files as you go.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about file storage options and practices at NYU, consult the <a href=\"http:\/\/guides.nyu.edu\/data_management\/storage_backup\" target=\"_blank\">Research Data Management library guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you call it the 3-2-1 Rule or the Rule of Three, when it comes to good storage of your data you need to plan for basic common scenarios for data loss.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_links_to":"","_links_to_target":""},"categories":[8],"tags":[62,61],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/345"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=345"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/345\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":383,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/345\/revisions\/383"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=345"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=345"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/data-services.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=345"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
