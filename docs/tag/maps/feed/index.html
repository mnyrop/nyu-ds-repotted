										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week I attended the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri) Annual User Conference in San Diego, California. This year’s conference on The Science of Where<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> started out with a keynote address titled “GIS &#8211; Inspiring What’s Next” given by Jack Dangermond, the president of Esri. Here are five things I learned at this year’s user conference.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>ArcMap:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While Esri is transitioning their ArcGIS Desktop software focus from ArcMap to ArcGIS Pro, ArcMap will continue to be supported for many years to come! This news at the plenary session was met with a round of applause, mine included. It’s important for us at NYU to embrace the future of GIS technology in ArcGIS Pro, but it’s equally important for us to be comfortable with some of the older GIS technology which is still widely used.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>ArcGIS Hub</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Billed as a new way to transform community engagement and collaboration, the </span><a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-hub/overview"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ArcGIS Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows for two-way engagement with an ArcGIS Organization and the community it serves. WIth ArcGIS Hub you can create maps and data visualizations that can be easily shared or collaborated on with members in the community. Plus, this platform was worked on in part by an NYU alumni!</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Living Atlas of the World</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The </span><a href="https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a collection of geographic data and is constantly changing and growing, with more than 7,000 items currently. It is composed of Esri content, Esri partner content, and User content and contains data layers, pre-made maps, and applications that you can use to build up your own web maps and applications. Check the </span><a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/arcgis-living-atlas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living Atlas Blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (yes, this is a thing!) for more useful content and information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Esri Vector Basemaps</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: So it’s not completely “new” news that Esri has offered users Vector Basemaps, but it’s worth mentioning how this change in basemap offerings can affect your maps. Vector basemaps use vector tiles that render on the client side rather than the Esri server side, unlike raster tiles. This change in rendering speeds up the process and makes the basemap image more clear. Additionally, you can create your own vector tile layers and customize map styles for use in your ArcGIS Online maps and apps. Vector Basemaps are currently on Version 2.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>OpenStreetMap Vector Basemap</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: And last, but certainly not least, Esri has announced that this summer it will release a beta version of OpenStreetMap Vector Basemap. You may be familiar with the raster OpenStreetMap basemap that is currently available on ArcGIS Online, but the new vector basemap option will be updated with the latest OSM data and Esri will continue to update this vector basemap frequently. Best yet, in keeping with the open data model, the Esri OpenStreetMap Vector Basemap will be freely available to any user, so this basemap will not be limited to ArcGIS Organization members!</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[GIS Day 2016 at NYU is less than a week away and we are introducing a multi-campus hack-a-thon event. What happens when NYU's global GIS Data Services team comes together to produce a series of spatial narratives and visualizations?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re less than a week away from <a href="http://tiny.cc/nyugisday">GIS Day 2016 at NYU</a>. In addition to our usually impressive lineup of GIS talks, exhibits, and maps, we are introducing a multi-campus hack-a-thon event. What happens when NYU&#8217;s GIS Data Services team, dispersed around the world, comes together <strong>at the last minute</strong> to work with data we already have and produce a series of narratives and visualizations?</p>
<p>We are about to find out. Our topic is Representations of China and the Middle East during the Cold War, and our task is to create a series of maps on platforms like <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/">ESRI&#8217;s StoryMaps</a>, <a href="https://nyu.carto.com">Carto</a>, and maybe other interfaces through which students and staff can explore these connections. Recognizing that we don&#8217;t have much time before GIS Day, we want to see if the process of coming together digging into data and resources, and having conversations with each other can yield something worthwhile, even if the product(s) that emerge are still in process.</p>

<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
<p>The idea for a hack-a-thon event emerged over the past few weeks. We wanted to call attention to the multiple ways that NYU supports GIS learning across the global campuses: collecting spatial data, making historical raster images available via the <a href="https://geo.nyu.edu">Spatial Data Repository</a>, and helping users find data and work with it in a variety of analytical and presentation software platforms.</p>
<p>Based on the idea of software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hack-a-thons</a>, this project is a collaborative event between the global sites that comprise New York University: New York&#8217;s <a href="https://guides.nyu.edu/dataservices">Data Services</a>, Abu Dhabi&#8217;s <a href="https://guides.nyu.edu/gisdata">Data Services</a> and growing Digital Humanities community, and <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/library/services">Shanghai&#8217;s Library</a>. During a weeklong stretch, members of the GIS team, faculty, and students at each of the three campuses will gather together to develop some project&#8211;a series of maps or exhibits&#8211;that explores the idea of Cold War ideologies and maps. Each team will work with data that NYU has collected and will explore the questions and methods associated with geographic information systems (GIS) analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Why Cold War Maps?</strong></p>
<p>Cartographic representations produced in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Cold War</a> are one way to explore the connection between the NYU campuses and the various digital humanities and social science research we support. As Timothy Barney has argued, maps produced by the United States, the U.S.S.R., and other countries are <a href="http://uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=3564">vehicles for articulating ideological tensions, national desire, and perceptions of power and global stewardship</a>. Maps rely upon both aesthetic and scientific forms of knowledge to produce and project imagined political relationships of power and dominance. Yet they are also windows into real, physical spaces and places at specific times in history. How these aesthetic and scientific projections take place is one main question undergirding the hack-a-thon.</p>

<p>NYU&#8217;s project begins with a book in our physical collection, entitled <em><a href="https://getit.library.nyu.edu/go/9411992">Communist China: Map Folio.</a></em> The book was published by the C.I.A. Office of Basic and Geographic Intelligence in 1967 and includes a series of maps that profile the population, energy sources, terrain, and infrastructure of &#8220;Communist China.&#8221; The book is an exemplar artifact of U.S. Cold War ideology; it represents dismissive attitudes toward Communism and speaks pejoratively about the struggles and rudimentary elements of Chinese infrastructure and production. We&#8217;ve taken several of the map sheets in this book, digitized them, and prepared them for analysis in a number of online mapping platforms.</p>
<p>We chose this topic because it is rife for the development of spatial humanities themes. Further, it will allow the larger NYU GIS community to explore some of the data and resources we already access, such as historical China Census population data from our SDR and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.6068/DP1584B10259C93">socio-demographic data from content providers like Data-Planet</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of the next week, the NYU Data Services team will provide newly-georeferenced raster maps to students and faculty at the global campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. In Abu Dhabi, <a href="http://djwrisley.com/">D.J. Wrisley</a>, Associate Professor of Digital Humanities, 2016-2017, will lead a team of students in his introductory Digital Humanities class as they explore concepts of mapping. At the same time, a team in Shanghai, coordinated by Kyle Greenberg, Adrian Hodge, and Clay Shirky, will come together to add to this project as well. We will be blogging this event and will assemble a gallery of maps created in time for GIS Day. Various members of the NYU Data Services team and NYU teaching community will write about lessons learned, questions asked, and more. Let the mapping and research begin!</p>
