										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year the New York State GIS Association held their <a href="http://geosummit2016.nysgis.net/" target="_blank">Geospatial Annual Meeting and 2016 Summit</a> on 21 October at New York University in the Bern Dibner Library of Science and Technology in downtown Brooklyn. The summit featured several excellent speakers who spoke about GIS in different disciplines.</p>
<p>Here are five things we learned at the NYS Geospatial Summit: </p>
<ol>
<li>From <a href="http://geosummit2016.nysgis.net/laura-bliss/" target="_blank">Laura Bliss</a>, we learned that there is a long, often-hidden, history of women involved in cartography and social/political map making.</li>
<li>As <a href="http://geosummit2016.nysgis.net/joseph-hlady/" target="_blank">Joseph Hlady</a> noted, the advent of automated vehicles, equipped with a variety of sensors, provides a significant source of data for measuring and appraising public infrastructure.</li>
<li>Creating algorithms which are fair, accountable, and transparent is a big topic of discussion these days, as <a href="http://geosummit2016.nysgis.net/arnaud-sahuguet/" target="_blank">Arnaud Sahuguet</a> argued, including within GIS communities.</li>
<li>Tomorrow&#8217;s GIS maps, particularly those related to travel and transportation, will be updated at a rate many times greater than today&#8217;s maps, with real-time collected data from sources such as vehicle-mounted lidar making for extremely detailed portraits of geospatial conditions.</li>
<li>Big data has transformed GIS just as surely as it has transformed other fields.</li>
