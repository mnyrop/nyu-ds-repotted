<p><strong>About the Collection and Data Release</strong></p>
<p>The 2015 LiDAR dataset is a landmark acquisition for geospatial data collections at NYU Libraries. It is the first time since the launch of our new Spatial Data Repository in 2016 that the GIS team has worked with researchers at NYU to bring a complex, multi-format original dataset into our collection. Many thanks to Stephen Balogh, Brittney ONeill, Ahn-Vu Vo, and others who put in incredible amounts of work on organizing the data for release and developing capacity for it.</p>
<p>Because of the size and complexity of the data, we had to take several new steps in order to present the data with enough spatial context to be useful to a range of geospatial researchers.Â One of the most frequent questions we anticipate about this data is, &#8220;what is it, and what can you do with it?&#8221; To help, the team has provided a 3D rendering of what the <a href="https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/ALSDublin15/potree/Dublin15.html">point cloud data</a> looks like when visualized (see below).</p>

<p>This is just one section of point cloud data, which anyone can download and visualize with a library like <a href="http://www.potree.org/">Potree</a>, though even this visualization is presenting a compressed and down-sampled version of the full waveform LiDAR, which is made available in LAS and Pulsewaves formats. Professor Laefer&#8217;s team has provided very robust documentation about the use of this data in research, and its <a href="https://osf.io/dk73g/wiki/home/">application for urban informatics scholarship</a>. To date, this type of data has been used to explore the detection of road curbs and obstacles, tree growth, and more.</p>
<p>The size and complexity of the data associated with the 2015 aerial laser scan has also required us to revise some of the ways that we have been presenting spatial data. In total, the data associated with just a two square kilometer area in Dublin is well over one terabyte and comes in at least four different formats, including point cloud, full waveform, and infrared GeoTIFF. We needed efficient ways for users to explore smaller subsets of the data and download files efficiently, so we expanded the interface of GeoBlacklight to afford for discovery according to individual flight paths or area of coverage.</p>

<p>Through our spatial discovery application, GeoBlacklight, users can find sections or subsets of the data that are important to them and download accordingly. We hope that this release of LiDAR data benefits the larger geospatial community, and we encourage you to explore the complete collection within NYU&#8217;s Spatial Data Repository.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The results of a crowd-sourced georectification project within Data Services have come to fruition as the NYU Spatial Data Repository has now released its rectified collection of topographic maps of Saudia Arabia and nearby regions. Produced by the Soviet military in 1978 at a 1:100,000 scale, the maps were compiled through a combination of aerial intelligence and on-the-ground observation. These maps are part of an endeavor, unknown in its extent at the time, that has been described as one of the &#8220;most comprehensive global topographic mapping project ever undertaken.&#8221;<sup>1</sup> Among their striking features are the close detail available on each sheet.<br />
<figure id="attachment_864" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-864" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img loading="lazy" src="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet-300x300.png" alt="The cities of Dhahran and Al Khobar in Saudia Arabia" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-864" srcset="https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet-300x300.png 300w, https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet-150x150.png 150w, https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet-768x768.png 768w, https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/sdr-soviet.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 85vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-864" class="wp-caption-text">The cities of Dhahran and Al Khobar in Saudia Arabia</figcaption></figure>
Data Services team members and friends gathered for two sessions over the last few months to georectify the maps in the open-source GIS software QGIS. Using bounding coordinate information listed on the maps, 441 map tiles were rectified and reprojected so that they could be displayed and used in GIS software alongside other raster and vector layers in standard WGS 84 (i.e. the World Geodetic System 1984, the standard spatial reference system). </p>
<p>Although human settlement features can be found in detail throughout the collection, they also describe a range of environmental features with hundreds of distinguished land and land-use types from categories of agriculture to forest, grass, soil types, and even five types of sand. Coastal areas can be compared to current coastlines to measure erosion and sea-level changes. Not conversant in Russian? An in-depth technical manual prepared by the U.S. Army in English, and available with the collection, will be your guide. To view the collection with spatial preview, <a href="https://geo.nyu.edu/?f%5Bdct_isPartOf_sm%5D%5B%5D=Soviet%20Military%20Topographic%20Maps&#038;per_page=20" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br /></br><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our latest collection update, we have added most of the currently available files from <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page">NYC Planning&#8217;s Bytes of the Big Apple</a>. Frequent users of the Bytes website appreciate it for its wealth of information, even while they might be frustrated with the somewhat fragmentary and arbitrary structure of data on the site.</p>
<p><a href="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/logo.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-543 alignleft" src="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/logo.png" alt="logo" width="150" height="133" /></a>By adding this data into our <a href="http://geo.nyu.edu">collection</a>, we&#8217;ve not only preserved it (and attached relevant documentation), but also made it exceedingly easy to add administrative boundaries and public data to NYC-related mapping projects. For example, look at this quick visualization of the Bronx. I&#8217;ve addedÂ the <a href="https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34520">MapPLUTO file of the Bronx</a> to my account in <a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/cartodb">CartoDB</a> and created a choropleth map that shows the year (before 1975 and after 1975) that each building was constructed.</p>

<p>By clicking on each parcel, you can see the year of its construction. This is just one element of the data available to be displayed; check out many others in the <a href="https://archive.nyu.edu/bitstream/2451/34520/4/pluto_datadictionary.pdf">PLUTO codebook</a>. In all, there are about 50 files added, and this is the first of many forthcoming additions of NYC spatial data.

					<description><![CDATA[This collects some reflections on challenges associated with web security and the use of HTTPS, taking work on our Spatial Data Repository as an example.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS protocol</a> for websites, instead of its older parent protocol, HTTP, offers significantly more protection and privacy for all parties involved in aÂ web transaction. HTTPS is a version of HTTP ââ the protocol that allows us to connect to websites in an internet browser ââ that encrypts all traffic uploaded or downloaded between a server and its client (you).</p>
<p>What exactly does this mean in practice? If you are surfing on a site via the HTTP protocol, then all of the data that is transmitted to or from that site is, by default, sent in anÂ unencrypted form. This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that your data is exposed for others to see, but it does mean that anyone who is in a position toÂ intercept the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet">packets</a> sent between you and the server mightÂ be able to see exactly what data was exchanged.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://geo.nyu.edu">Spatial Data Repository</a>Â at Data Services has supported HTTPS connections, but up until very recently, only the connection between the server that runs the repository and the user who accesses it was encrypted. SomeÂ of the external sources of data, loaded when a user accesses a SDR record,Â still used theÂ HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>To understand thisÂ better, consider the fact that most websites are in realityÂ a combinationÂ of content from disparate sources; some of the sources areÂ hosted locally, on the same site you navigated to in your browser, and some are hostedÂ externally. (If you&#8217;re interested in investigating the origin of content on any site, try playing aroundÂ with the &#8220;Network&#8221; section of the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/network">Chrome browser&#8217;s Developer Tools</a>). This combination of sources certainly characterizesÂ content found onÂ the Spatial Data Repository; accessing anyÂ pageÂ on the SDR requires a user to load content from a variety ofÂ other servers.Â And this is where our problem was located ââÂ even though geo.nyu.edu was protected by HTTPS,Â the feature on the site thatÂ allows users to preview map extents had to make use of anÂ unencrypted HTTP connection to our map servers. And as a result, the security of the site was a little less than idealÂ ââ maybe evenÂ particularly so, since the website suggests that the SDR is entirelyÂ secure just by virtue of the fact that its domain begins with an &#8220;https://&#8221;!</p>

<p>A good illustration of why this can be riskyÂ is the following.</p>
<p>With HTTPS content, the encryption works in such a way that all data sent between a client and a server appears completely unintelligible when viewed by a third party. This is why virtually all e-commerce sites use HTTPS ââ even if a connection is compromised, your passwords and bank details are safe. I wanted to see what an attacker might see should they be able to intercept traffic between a user and the Spatial Data Repository. Using software that analyzes network packetsÂ (I used <a href="http://packetpeeper.org/">Packet Peeper</a>, but there are a ton of these) I took a look at some traffic collected as I browsedÂ around records.</p>
<p>Whenever I browsed a page directly hostedÂ by the SDR, the traffic was, as expected, unintelligible:</p>
<figure id="attachment_423" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-423" style="width: 224px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-18-at-5.57.53-PM.png" rel="attachment wp-att-423"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-423" src="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-18-at-5.57.53-PM-224x300.png" alt="An example of a network packet sent via an encrypted HTTPS connection" width="224" height="300" srcset="https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-18-at-5.57.53-PM-224x300.png 224w, https://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-18-at-5.57.53-PM.png 702w" sizes="(max-width: 224px) 85vw, 224px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-423" class="wp-caption-text">An example of a network packet sent via an encrypted HTTPS connection</figcaption></figure>
<p>But when I kept looking, I eventually found some traffic that was sent out to an external service via HTTP. Looking carefully, you can see the name of the map I requested, and even which subset of it I was particularly interested in:</p>
<figure id="attachment_418" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-418" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-18-at-5.20.14-PM.png" rel="attachment wp-att-418"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-418" src="http://data-services.hosting.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-18-at-5.20.14-PM-300x226.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-18 at 5.20.14 PM" width="411" height="309" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-418" class="wp-caption-text">Not encrypted! A look inside a regular packet from HTTP (visualized in Packet Peeper)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even though my activity on the main page was encrypted, the simple fact that one of the associated connections made fromÂ the page was not encrypted meant that anyone in a position to intercept network traffic could deduce a lot about how I was using the site.</p>
<p>Would this be the end of the world? No. But doÂ I think it&#8217;s an important security consideration that might be overlooked in other contexts? Yes! And luckily, it is now the case that all (<em>knock on wood</em>) external connections made from pages on geo.nyu.edu will be served up via HTTPS.</p>
<p>Stay green, ol&#8217; padlock!</p>
