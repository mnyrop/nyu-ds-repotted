										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I returned from Lexington, KY, where I attended the <a href="http://www.loexconference.org/">2017 LOEX Annual Conference</a>. This is the third time I have presented at LOEX, and it&#8217;s always a great conference that focuses on instruction and pedagogy. My talk was on &#8220;Teaching Power and Authority in Library Discovery Systems&#8221; (<a href="http://tiny.cc/loex2017">slides available here</a>). Here&#8217;s a list of things I gathered.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>My own talk was about ways in which the academy reifies and circulates authority, so I&#8217;m sad that I missed <a href="https://t.co/Mp7XqE4sGu">Alex Watkins&#8217;s talk on inclusive authority</a>. Watkins suggests that many faculty &#8220;have restrictive source requirements that mirror and perpetuate the systematic exclusion of indigenous knowledge from academia.&#8221; The &#8220;Authority is Constructed and Contextual&#8221; Frame provides many opportunities to discuss this in practice with students. What do students (and faculty) stand to gain or lose by questioning this economy?</li>
<li>As per my NYU colleagues, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kentuckys-Domain-Power-Greed-Corruption/dp/0595159915">Nicole Brown and Marybeth McCartin</a>, social learning exercises are important strategies for creating a community of practice that focuses of pedagogical development. Nicole and Marybeth modeled several activities, including <a href="http://shelfcheck.blogspot.com/2014/01/cards-against-librarianship-lets-play.html">Librarian Cards Against Humanity</a>. I would argue it&#8217;s a more effective assessment mechanism of organizational culture than <a href="https://www.climatequal.org/home">ClimateQUAL</a> (just kidding).</li>
<li>The conference was held at the Lexington Convention Center, which affords this luxury:<br />

<p>— Beth Black (@b_l_black) <a href="https://twitter.com/b_l_black/status/863065357891842048">May 12, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Since I lived in Lexington for six years, I told people about some of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kentuckys-Domain-Power-Greed-Corruption/dp/0595159915">scandalous backstory</a> of how the convention center came to be.</li>
<li>Lane Wilkinson gave a great talk about ways to teach evaluation of sources in an era where we are saturated with rhetoric of fake news, confirmation bias, and &#8220;alternative facts.&#8221; One of the best takeaways from this talk is that <a href="http://www.truthrevolt.org/news/viral-chart-claims-fight-fake-news-promotes-biased-media">this viral graphic</a> is utter garbage. It makes me mad every time I see it.</li>
<li>The #critlib conversation is expanding more than ever, and many librarians are drawing from <a href="https://t.co/4i3mRXQu8W">Michelle Alexander and Angela Y. Davis</a> to form their approach to teaching.</li>
